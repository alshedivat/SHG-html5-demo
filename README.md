SHG HTML5 demo-model
====================

I wrote this quick demo in August, 2011, as a handy visualization of the popular experimental setting we have been using at (NanoLab)[http://nanolab.phys.msu.ru/] for different cross-correlation intensity measurements that rely on the second harmonic generation (SHG) in a nonlinear crystal. Just recently I moved the code to kinetic-5.1.0.js and made the graphics look pretty on retina displays.
